# Summary

* What
  * They suggest a single architecture that tries to solve the following tasks:
    * Face localization ("Where are faces in the image?")
    * Face landmark localization ("For a given face, where are its landmarks, e.g. eyes, nose and mouth?")
    * Face landmark visibility estimation ("For a given face, which of its landmarks are actually visible and which of them are occluded by other objects/people?")
    * Face roll, pitch and yawn estimation ("For a given face, what is its rotation on the x/y/z-axis?")
    * Face gender estimation ("For a given face, which gender does the person have?")

* How
  * 

* Results
