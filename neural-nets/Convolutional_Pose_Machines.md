# Summary

* What
  * They suggest a new model for human pose estimation (i.e. to lay a "skeleton" over the image of a person).
  * Their model has a (more or less) recurrent architecture.
    * Initial estimates of keypoint locations are refined in several steps.
    * The idea of the recurrent architecture is derived from message passing, unrolled into one feed-forward model.
